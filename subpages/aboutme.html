            <h1 class="personality_header">about me</h1>
            <p class="personality_text"> My name is Kristine, but you can call me Kris. I am 27 years young and I am
                coming
                from Jurmala, Latvia. I
                was born in a bilingual family which gave me a strong base of understanding cultural diversity. I love
                to
                explore - people, cultures, countries, nature, myself.<br><br>


                I really believe that the path of self development is never-ending. I love challenges. I believe that
                facing
                and overcoming obstacles and difficulties is the most efficient way of learning and gaining new
                experiences.</p>
            <img src="../photos/aboutme.png" alt="Kristine Photo" class="personality_photo mobile">

            <p class="personality_text"> I have an analytical and pragmatical mindset. I am able to analyse information,
                identify and solve
                complex
                problems. I am curious, therefore I always ask “why” and want to understand and learn how to do things
                better. When I identify the problem and solution, I always view the entire picture to get to the end
                result.
                I have a linear, practical way of thinking and “doing”.</p>

            <p class="experience_text">I have finished studies in Riga Trade technical school on a
                marketing
                and
                advertising
                program. During these studies I have learned about principles of visual advertising, ethics and
                legislation of advertising and communications. <br><br>

                After my studies I was working in McDonalds as a General manager’s assistant and did a local store
                marketing as well as being responsible for training and HR. <br><br>

                In 2016 I moved to live to London and lived there for 2 years. I was working as a General manager’s
                assistant<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> in a spanish restaurant. While spending all
                    my free time on traveling and exploring, this
                    passion brought me to USA. I lived 1 year in Florida as well as traveling across states. This time I
                    spent living abroad and travelling was a precious experience which allowed me to open my mind and
                    completely changed my worldview and vision of life. I became more broad-minded, fulfilled and
                    versatile.
                    <br><br>

                    In 2019 I came to Denmark to start my studies in Multimedia Design program. This program thought me
                    to
                    go through all the process from developing the idea to the final solution. I have chosen to
                    specialise
                    in frontend development, but I am also interested to create a good UX / UI and create the design
                    which
                    matches to the client or product. </span></p>
