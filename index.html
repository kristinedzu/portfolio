      <p class="aboutme_text">I am 27 years young student based in Aarhus, Denmark. Passionate about digital design,
        development, UI and UX.<br><br>
        I really believe that the path of self development is never-ending. I love challenges. I believe that facing and
        overcoming obstacles and difficulties is the most efficient way of learning and gaining new experiences.
        <br><br>

        Love to travel, explore and grow. I am seeking for new experiences and self-development. I am always ready for
        new challenges and open for all oportunities. I am a team-player with highly developed leadership skills, self
        organisation and time-managment. </p>

          our collaboration was not only very satisfying but also challenging. She's a very strong character, that also
          respects opinion of everyone else . I've never heard someone saying "I don't agree" in such a beautiful way as
          Kris does!<br><br> I personally love to debate with her, as it's the best conversation that sets the bar for
          the
          project really high.</p>
